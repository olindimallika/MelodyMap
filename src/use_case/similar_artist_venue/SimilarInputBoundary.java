 *
 * This method is a central part of the application's functionality, responsible for orchestrating
 * the process of discovering similar artists and venues. The SimilarInputData object encapsulates
 * all the necessary information required for this use case, such as artist names, geographic locations,
 * and classification criteria.
 *
 * The implementation of this method will typically involve interactions with various components,
 * including data access layers, to retrieve relevant information. It may also include processing
 * and analyzing the input data to determine similar artists and venues. If any exceptional scenarios
 * occur during execution, such as network issues or data inconsistencies, this method may throw
 * exceptions to signal specific error conditions.
 *
 * Clients invoking this method should be aware of the potential exceptions and handle them appropriately.
 * For example, logging the exception, notifying the user, or taking corrective actions based on the
 * nature of the error. Here's an example of how to use this method:
